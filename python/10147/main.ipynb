    "description = [\"Rich and round, this offers plenty of concentrated blackberry notes enveloped in warm spices and supple oak. There's a hint of green tomato leaves throughout, but the lush fruit combined with sturdy grape tannins and high acidity would pair well with fatty short ribs or braised pork.\", \"This luminous sparkler offers measured aromas of yellow fruit and honey and delivers a broad, wide approach in the mouth. The wine's texture is creamy and full and there is a spicy point of effervescence on the palate.\", \"There are some pretty features to this wine, namely the lovely tannins and rich fruit, but it's just too soft and sweet. Tastes like blackberry jam, with extra white sugar spinkled on top.\", \"Lovely nose, which runs from violets and cherries right into coffee and sweet chocolate. In the mouth the wine coats the palate with Napa-like intensity, only buttressed with more vivid acidity. It's both smooth and deep. The aromas are more detailed, interesting and really clean, loaded with dark flavors of soy, coffee, molasses and black cherry liqueur.\", \"Tastes sweeter and fruitier than the 2009, which was dry, so if you like orange marmalade, pineapple tart and vanilla cookie sugariness in your Sauvignon Blancs, it's for you.\", \"The Jaume family's business is thriving because of wines like this that faithfully represent their terroirs while offering solid value. This raspberry- and garrigue-scented wine features ample weight framed by supple tannins that firm up on the finish. Drink now 2018.\", 'Beautifully pure apple fruit plays on nose and palate. Citrus juice frames the fruit and heightens the freshness even more. If you like a slender, supercrisp style of Riesling, the purity of this will have you hooked.', \"This was a very good vintage for Goldeneye, the best since '01. The fruit got ripe, offering up a big mouthful of jammy cherry and raspberry flavors accented with sweet oak. The tannin-acid balance is just great. It's delicious, yet has all kinds of complex edges and nuances.\", 'Shows classic varietal flavors of cherries, raspberries and Dr. Pepper, with a sweet edge of smoky oak. Enjoyable now for its forward fruit and silky texture.', \"A very nice, casual Merlot that has layers of complex elegance beyond just the fruit. And what fruit it is, ripe and sweet in cherry pie, raspberry cream, cola and vanilla, with a splash of cassis. Fortunately, there's enough acidity and tannin for balance.\", \"Opens with hard, rubbery, leathery aromas. In the mouth, it's thick and chewy with black fruit but also an herbal edge. There's depth and plenty of oak here, and it finishes sweet and relatively smooth. Starts rough, improves in the middle, and then finishes fairly well.\", 'A tough, gritty little Pinot Noir, not quite ripe. It smells and tastes of green mint and peppercorns, alongside the cherries and cola, and is rugged in texture.', 'Opulent and ripe, full bodied and rich, this has notes of toast and spice as well as apricot and pear flavors. With its balanced character, it can be consumed now, but it will also age for another year.', 'Coffee grinds, raisin and baked aromas suggest overripeness. This is heavy, broad and a bit clumsy on the palate. Berry and prune flavors are solid but not overly fresh, while the finish is full and raisiny as it improves over time.', 'Gentle red-cherry fruit, soft and pliable tannins and fresh acidity combine to make this a simple and cheerful light red for drinking now.', 'Hot, tannic and simple, with cherry jam and currant flavors accompanied by high, tart acidity and chile-pepper alcohol heat. An unbalanced wine.', 'Big, fruity wine, with layers of fruit, earth, toast and oak. Spicy cranberry/raspberry fruit leads into toasty, dry tannins. There is a lovely density, buttressed with new oak, but anchored with ripe, firm fruit. Lovely winemaking.', 'Big, ripe and fruity, it combines a rich character along with the firmest tannins and dense structure. Acidity adds a touch of freshness, while the structure and full fruit are concentrated and still young. Give this solid, dark wine at least until 2020.', \"Here's a good buy in a nice, dry, crisp young Sauvignon Blanc. It has subtle green grass, citrus and vanilla flavors, and finishes clean and zesty.\", \"This is a pretty, delicately perfumed Pinot Noir, with elegantly intertwined cherry and herb notes. It's light to medium in body, with a finish that shows just a touch of sinewy intensity. Drink it over the next year or so.\", \"Wonderfully rich with lush dark chocolate and espresso notes, this is another lovely, highly drinkable Merlot from Comtesse Therese. There's a good amount of charred oak, but it's integrated seamlessly with concentrated black plum and berry flavors. The finish is long, and accented by pleasant astringency of walnut skins and tobacco.\", 'Foxy cherry and cough drop aromas are not convincing. Feels astringent and tastes tart, with sharp but candied cherry, faux oak and milk chocolate flavors. Blends sour notes with sweet oak, all to little avail.', \"This is a simple and cheerful Nero d'Avola that would pair well with white meats such as roast chicken or pork. Aromas here include blueberry, forest berry and there's a touch of bitter almond on the close.\", 'Forward and lush, with a beautiful structure, this dry, balanced wine has cherry, cassis, wintergreen and oak flavors that finish in a swirl of complexity. This fine wine defines the elegance and femininity of a great Rutherford Cab, and should age well through 2012.', \"A lush and enormously fruity auslese, this offering features layers of appealingly ripe fruit, ranging from honeyed peaches to tropically luscious mangoes. If it's a bit fat and lacks a touch of zip, it makes up for it with sheer deliciousness.\", 'Oak tonneaux aging renders a rounder, softer and easier-to-drink Brunello. Beautiful layers of aromatic intensity include white mushroom, herbal notes, sweet cedar wood, tobacco, vanilla and cherry. Imported by Tutto Vino.', 'A bit disappointing on the nose; pickle barrel and onion are supported by moderate spice. This is a dark, extracted wine with dusty tannins and a lean feel. Cherry/berry fruit flavors are shy as they compete with tomato, spice and onion before finishing metallic.', 'Creamy wine, flavored with pears, almonds and crisp acidity. The wine is taut and crisp at the same time. The aftertaste, otherwise fresh, is spoilt by a yeasty bitterness.', 'A masterpiece from this near perfect vintage. Completely ripe, classic and fresh, with oodles of red cherry and blackcurrant flavors that are generously oaked. Amazingly, the wine is still young and tannic. So beautifully structured, so smooth and polished, firm yet soft, just a gorgeous wine. Hold onto it until at least 2012, if you can.', \"A splendid Alvarinho, produced in the southern Vinho Verde region, with ripe creaminess as well as shafts of lime juice and grapefruit. It's ready to drink, while it could age for another year.\", \"There's something subtlely unripe about this Pinot Noir. It show up in the aroma, with a trace of stewed asparagus. Still, it's dry and elegant, and the flavors of sour cherry candy and sandalwood make it all right.\", \"It doesn't take a great brain to figure out that this is a rocking, beautifully crafted international red wine. Mint, spice and chocolate aromas are dipped in lovely new oak, while the palate is all about bold plum backed by coffee and mocha. Stellar now and shows all signs of a wine that will only get better. Imported by Vias Imports.\", \"Known for its panoramic, family-run bed & breakfast, Ca' du RabajaŠ's base Barbaresco offers a light, bright appearance with aromas of white chocolate, vanilla, orange zest and wild berry. There's smoke, licorice and tar in there as well and the wine offers a tart but drying finish.\", \"Well oaked and woodsy, with some earthy nuances as well as scents of campfire and rubber. This is a youngster with aggressive tannins and sharp edges. With a bit of time it'll soften, leaving a top-flight wine with cherry, citrus rind and a hint of sweet oak.\", \"A sweet-smelling Soave with simple aromas of peach, pear and honey presented in a very direct and immediate manner. It's thick and compact on the finish with loads of pineapple-like flavors.\", 'This is a fresh and light Extra Dry style Prosecco with a luminous appearance and tonic bubbles. The aromas recall citrus, white flower and peach and the bubbly wine would taste great as an aperitivo.', \"This isn't a very complex Merlot, but it is textbook if you're looking for soft fruitiness. It has oak-influenced cherry and blackberry flavors, with hints of violets and fruit tea, and is dry and dusty in tannins. Give it more concentration and it would be a star.\", 'From a small appellation in the north of the Maconnais, producing reds as well as whites, this is initially a mineral, citric wine, which broadens out with toast, fresh acidity and a good weight, with lychee and yellow fruits.', \"There's a Floodgate Vineyard in Anderson Valley that produces very nice Pinot Noirs, but this one says it's from Russian River Valley. This wine is average in quality. It has a fine, silky mouthfeel, with some good cherry flavors, but also a sharp, green touch of mint that's unlikely to age out.\", 'This Brut Saten offers a creamy mouthfeel accented by cheerful tones of yellow fruit, almond and dried apricot. There is crispness here and the tonic bubbles help keep the palate clean for your next sip.', \"Sharp and penetrating, vertically structured, and just now coming out of its youthful shell, the 2006 is beginning to show its long- term aging potential. Compact blueberry and blackberry fruit comes with a hint of black olive; it's ripe, quite firm and wrapped into chewy tannins and natural acids, with a lemony finish.\", \"Slightly nutty and salinic on the nose, but mostly it's just neutral. Seems like an early maturing wine, meaning it's soft in its delivery of melon and apple flavors. Dry and a touch pithy on the finish.\", 'Dry, crisp and a bit one-dimensional, this Pinot offers pleasant flavors of cherries, cola, oranges, vanilla and smoke. Seems a bit pricey. Drink now.', \"Paje is a beautiful amphitheater of vines in Barbaresco known for finesse and elegance. This older vintage maintains very good integrity of fruit that is enhanced by layers of black licorice, mineral notes, ash, tobacco and cola. But at the heart of it all is a blast of red cherry. It's a vertical, intense and streamlined wine that is ready to drink now.\", 'A bit hard in tannins and stinging in acidity, but the lush, ripe flavors make up for it. Offers waves of black and red cherries, cola, licorice and bacon flavors, accented with sweet, smoky oak. Good now, and should develop for a few years.', \"Made in a lighter, silkier, more accessible style, this is an elegant Pinot Noir that suggests lamb, roast salmon and other upscale dishes. It's easy to drink, but also complex, with intricately layered flavors of cherries, raspberries, red currants, licorice, sassafras, sweet smoky cedar and Asian spices.\", 'This wine made from Muscat Canelli grapes is slightly spritzy and sweet, pungent in apricot fuzz and grass, a melange of tropical goodness from there on out. Mango, kiwi and pineapple fill the medium-weight waves of viscous texture, concluding in a vanilla-tinged, light, fresh finish.', \"This medium-bodied Riesling combines relatively high alcohol (13%) with ample residual sugar to add even greater richness and mouthfeel. But because of its excellent levels of acidity, it doesn't come across as particularly sweet or heavy. Tangerine, apple and spice notes linger elegantly on the finish.\", 'A bit murky and damp on the nose, with brandied fruit and raisin aromas. The palate is solidly formed, with basic raspberry flavors but not much follow through as the finish shows buttery, soft flavors. Inoffensive but more generic than individual.', \"Dark and heavy, almost Rhone-like, with significant tannins that interfere with palate pleasure. There's a deep core of black cherries and lots of oak. Could develop.\", 'A full, balanced wine with layers of grapefruit and a pure citrus streak. Secondary flavors of almonds and toast add complexity. This is not profound, but it is eminently enjoyable.', \"Here's a lovely sparkling wine that offers a floral fragrance of white flowers and tropical fruit. The palate delivers apple, white peach and a hint of almond. It has a creamy texture and a clean, crisp finish. A classic Franciacorta.\", \"Starts out with pleasant notes of supple fruit, but there's too much oak showing at the moment, and the fruit quickly gets buried. Some bitter tannins conclude; give this one extra airtime to soften it up.\", 'Despite notes of honey and baked apple, this is an almost dry wine, boasting plenty of weight in the mouth. Orangey flavors pick up hints of peach and dried spices, turning stony on the finish.', \"Tough in tannins, austerely dry and thin in fruit, this Cab lacks voluptuousness. You'll find cooked cherry-berry flavors that are swamped by alcohol and tannins.\", 'Tastes like ripeness ran away with this wine. The blackberry flavors are explosive, making it taste like jam, while the oak is very strong, almost overpowering in smoky char. Pretty good, but overworked. Drink soon.', 'For those who love the austere, steel and stone flavors of bone-dry Riesling, this will be a welcome discovery. It has plenty of power, citrus rind flavors of fruit and skin, a persistent minerality and a clean, fresh finish.', \"Stalky aromas suggest corn and hayfield more than crisp fruit, and while the palate is lively and acidic, it's also kind of sour and lemony. Finishes with green apple and citrus. Jumpy and scouring.\", 'Tastes immature now, with the toasty oak not yet integrated, and the tannins also stick out in all their sticky glory. The fruit is exceptionally ripe, suggesting grilled blackberries and black currants. The suggestion is ageability. Better sometime after mid-2010.', \"This is off-dry, roughly 2% residual sugar, and the sweetness is quite evident. It's rather fleshy for a Gewarzt, with honeysuckle, melon and peach fruit. There is a nice spiciness to the aroma as well, and it carries into the midpalate, lending a welcome streak of licorice.\", 'A fine, elegant wood-aged wine. It has ripe fruits, sweet peach, apricot, mango, while the vanilla of toast lifts all the flavors, adding spicy smoothness. Acidity comes from fresh lime. It could do with some aging, maybe 2’3 years.', \"Quite an oaky wine, with aromas of BBQ, hickory, roasted plum and spice. The body is full but scratchy, with additional oak manifesting itself in the form of baked, rooty, vanilla flavors that override the wine's simple but quiet fruit content. Finishes dark and toasty, with coffee, mocha and vanilla flavors.\", \"A new bottling from the winery, made from vines grown 2,000 feet up the mountain that were planted only in 2001. It's far too immature to drink now or anytime soon. The tannins are thick and on lockdown, the blackberry, cassis and cherry fruit all primary and not yet integrated with the oak. But these parts are high-quality and need time to mesh and develop. Best after 2010 through 2016 and beyond.\", \"Made in the modern style of soft, sweet opulence, this is insanely rich, with notes of cherry marmalade, red currant, milk chocolate and sweet cedar flavors that continue onto the long, smooth finish. It's a blend of the traditional red Bordeaux varieties, and while it was aged in 100% new French oak, it's not too oaky. Drink over the next six years for its youthful beauty.\", \"This is a heavy, dense and not very rewarding Pinot Noir at this time. It's soft and full-bodied and very ripe in cherries, blackberries and cola flavors. Could age to mellow sweetness, but it's a gamble.\", 'A solid and very drinkable wine, the forward black fruit elements are accented by hints of fudge and sweet spice on the finish Drink now.', 'Crisp acidity and a gorgeous, aromatic nose lead on this elegant white. Though mineral-driven, it offers generous white peach and grapefruit flavors that will pair well with fuller-bodied fish. Impressive and versatile.', \"This smells horsy, feral and herbal. Dry, rock-hard tannins make it feel rugged in the mouth, and it's already five years old.\", 'The extra amount of clay in the soil of this vineyard lends weight, richness and roundness. At the same time, it has fresh lime, an open character and a soft structure.', 'This warm-weather Viognier is fleshy and chunky on the bouquet, with generic white-fruit aromas that suggest gardenias. A plump palate is low on acid and heavy in weight; flavors of melon and green herbs finish soft and could turn flabby in a short time.', \"Here's an oak-driven Sauvignon Blanc from the 2004 vintage with a thick layer of toast, nut and campfire that play a leading role and leave little room for the wine's natural fruit and floral tones. Those carpentry notes also dominate the mouthfeel and add a piquant touch of exotic spice on the close. That said, this white wine has held very well over the years.\", \"CUNE is a throwback bodega whose wines won't appeal to followers of the new wave. And since I consider myself a backer of the modern style, I found this wine too obtuse, funky and borderline dirty to rate higher. It's full of mossy, stewy flavors and the feel is heavy. Traditionalist, however, may find it worthy of greater praise.\", 'Offers lush, intricate flavors of blackberries, cassis, roasted coffeebean, sweet milk chocolate and toasty oak in a soft, gentle wine that has complexity and interest. Not an ager, but a real beauty.', \"Ripe indeed, with confectioner's sugar, vanilla ice cream and honey aromas that lead to a light-to-medium-bodied palate with some disjointed oak notes and a slightly oily texture. Short but pleasant finish of figs and candied lemons. Drink up.\", 'Tropical fruit aromas lead to a peach- and apricot-flavored palate. It shows old-vine concentration, spice from having aged in wood and a generous, velvet-like texture that is balanced by a fine shot of lemony acidity. Age this for 4’5 years.', 'Produced by the winemaking team of Chateau Giscours in Margaux, this is impressive for a simple Bordeaux. It has weight, rich blackberry fruits, structure and concentration. It could even age.', 'Typical of this hot vintage, La Fiammenga is already quite mature. The fruit is on the plummy side, it has the added complexity of licorice and road tar. On the palate, it is soft and rich but it does need a touch of acid to liven it up. Imported by Sapori Italiani Inc.', 'The estate bottling is 100% Semillon and tastes a bit riper and more peachy than the Columbia Valley bottling, though perhaps less nuanced. Barrel fermented in both new and second year French oak, it adds honeysuckle, sweet apple and a hint of mint to the sweet fruit.', \"Not the most Syrah-like wine you're likely to encounter, but as a generic red it's juicy, fruity and tasty. The balance is fine and the fruit weighs in solid and proper. Complete but lacking individuality.\", 'This is all tannin, bitter chocolate and a dense texture. It seems to be drying out as the fruit goes, while there are few signs of softening. It suffers from the heat of 2003.', 'Of all the 2012 releases from Mannina, this is the most dense, dark and substantial. Cassis and black cherry fruit is set against a stiff streak of char and coffee, backed with firm, ripe tannins. The length and balance are just right for ripe fruit from young vines.', 'A success in the sweeter Vinho Verde category. There is pleasant softness, flavors of green berries, grapefruit with sugar and freshness.', \"This wonderful auslese offers volume and richness without weight“it's a sort of fluffy custard in texture, loaded with funky, leesy notes on the nose but also with passion fruit, green apple and pineapple notes on the palate. Yes, it's sweet, but the acids provide beautiful balance on the finish. Drink now’2025.\", 'The modest cherry, dark berry and black tea notes of this light wine show tell-tale orange-peel notes of decline. This feels just too thin and tired at an early age.', 'With its thick density and slightly off-dry flavors of raisin, cassis, honey and liquid smoke, this would pair with hearty country pate or meat terrines. Its alcohol, mild tannins and fresh-fruit finish would also work with those fatty foods.', 'A nose of strawberry and mint with a whiff of petrol sets the scene for flavors of cassis, cherry preserves, peach and eucalyptus that never quite coalesce. Soft tannins drop off immediately after a burst of white peach at the finish.', 'A fairly big wine, with big tannins and high acidity, that lets its flavors do the talking. Lush purple fruit and coffee is streaked with lemon and mineral. A bit tart on the finish, but with food this is enjoyable for its swagger.', 'This attractively priced Pinot Noir combines fruit from Nelson and Marlborough to create a fresh, snappy blend of plum and black cherry fruit. Some slightly briary-herbal notes and silky tannins add interest, smoothed out by hints of brown sugar and baking spices. Drink now’2012.', 'This 100% Feteasca Neagra has aromas of fresh strawberry and red plum. It is soft on entry into the mouth and has flavors of dried cherries, cloves and prunes.', 'This refreshing Chardonnay“with aromas of grapefruit and lemon and flavors of zesty grapefruit and lemon zest“is anchored by a weight that gives it balance. Overall, the wine finds a great middle ground and is food friendly.', \"Tasted in October, 2007, the wine was mute, offering little aromatically except for teasing notes of blackberries and oak. That shyness extended to the taste, where strong, hard tannins provide an almost impenetrable coat of armor to what's inside. But right down the middle of the palate is a deep, intensely powerful stream of perfectly ripened cassis that's all the proof you need of ageability. This is a magnificently structured young wine, reminiscent of a fine young Pauillac. Best after 2012, and should have another decade after that, at least.\", \"It's impossible for a Cabernet to be richer, more opulent or more hedonistically stunning on opening than this beauty from veteran Phelps. Admittedly, there are significant tannins. But the wine delivers a broadside of the sweetest, ripest cassis fruit imaginable, along with richly toasted oak. It's the kind of Cab that will dazzle even an amateur. Absolutely gorgeous now, with immaculate elegance. About the only criticism you can offer is that the structure is a bit obvious, and ageability may be limited.\", \"The former basketball star's initial release immediately establishes itself among the elite Cabernets of Napa Valley. Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, creme de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins. This is one of those wines that is softly decadent from start to finish, although it's probably not one to hold much beyond six years.\", \"Made in the Lokoya style, which is darkly colored, full bodied, tannic and dense in mountain fruit. A spicy oak tone joins with massive blackberry, cassis and violet flavors to make this wine delicious from the start. It's very tannic and needs a great deal of time. Begin to enjoy this wine in 2016, and it should go far longer than that.\", 'A disappointing wine. Tastes frankly unripe, with a vegetal undertow to the blackberries and cherries. The thinness of fruit accentuates the alcohol which, although only 14.6%, comes through as hot. The grapes came from the cool Coombsville area, and the wine is 100% Cabernet.', \"Granular, raisiny and heavy on the nose, with jammy blackberry aromas. The palate then hits with a thud; it's chunky and low in acidity, which yields a thick flavor set of prune and coffee. Better once it breathes, but it's still a bit too sticky and syrupy for our liking.\", 'The \\x8foakÂ‰Ã›Â\\x9d in the name is appropriate because this one is draped in unctuous, heavy, burnt aromas. The nose is a cloud of coconut, char and woody blackberry, while the syrupy palate is all sweet black plum, carob, mint and resin. Quite oaky and thick for a value-priced wine.', \"Jammy red-fruit aromas mixed with buttery oak make for a simple, sappy nose. There's more butter on the palate in addition to solid blackberry flavors. It finishes round but short, with yet another wave of barrel. A very good wine but not one that wows.\", 'Rubbery and warm on the nose, with earthy plum and blackberry aromas. The palate is full and bouncy, with appropriate plum, berry and cassis flavors. Nice for standard New World Cab, with fig, chocolate and no buttery, sloppy oak.', 'Colorful but low in pulse, with jammy, pasty aromas sitting in front of a bulky, one-dimensional palate that offers standard blackberry fruit and mildly herbal side flavors. Has just enough acidity to keep it pumping, but as a whole it comes across a little too heavy and jammy compared to previous years.']\n",

    "description = ['A bit too soft and thus lacks structure. Shows a good array of wild berry and briary, brambly flavors. Dry and spicy, and ready now.', 'Aromas of toasted oak, vanilla and a confectionary note lead the nose while the palate offers mature Golden Delicious apple, butterscotch and walnut skin alongside bracing acidity.', 'Heavy in alcohol and overripe, but entirely dry, and the black currant, chocolate and pepper flavors will play well against richly sauced barbecue.', \"Fragrant; dusty plum and rose aromas are followed on the palate by very fruity flavors of cherries and apple skins. The fine bead and rich mousse result in a creamy mouthfeel. It's all a bit obvious and simple, but undeniably good.\", 'Layers of plush yellow peach and apricot flavors highlight this easy, crowd-pleasing kabinett. Sunny lemon acidity lends refreshment to the midpalate, cutting through all the ripeness and leading to a brisk finish. Drink now through 2019.', 'A boisterous, easy-drinking red wine that gushes ripe fruit and sweet oak aromas. It tastes almost sweet, like blackberry jam, and seems soft-textured in spite of its full body.', \"Superripe and oaky in pineapple, white peach purae, pear tart, buttered toast and vanilla-infused crame bralae, this Chardonnay is saved from mere richness by crisp coastal acidity and a fine spine of minerals. Exotic and delicious, it's at its best now.\", 'This is a fresh wine that has been aged in tanks, retaining its bright red fruits and lively acidity. It is still young although it will develop quickly to give a soft fruit-driven wine.', 'This white is a study in unexpected complexity and pleasure. Quince, sulfur and grapefruit notes define it best, as supple minerality and gravelly texture provide dimensionality.', 'There are a lot of uncommon, unusual elements to this Pinot. For starters, the nose is volatile, with notes of horseradish and grapefruit. The palate has a solid, juicy feel to it, while mulchy cherry and plum flavors finish aimlessly.', 'Mediterra opens with intense aromas of bell pepper, red currants, sage and black pepper. The round palate offers lush plum and blackberry layered with nutmeg, clove and pepper. Pair it with a variety of foods including cured meats and medium aged cheeses.', 'A green, struggling wine from front to back. The nose kicks up underripe aromas to go with distant red fruit, while the palate is edgy and prickly, with high acidity creating snappy cherry and green flavors.', \"All stainless, no malolactic and widely available distribution make this a pure-blooded warm weather go-to white wine. It's young and still a bit yeasty, aromatic with scents of seeds and grains. Tightly wound fruit flavors of apple and green melon come with good depth and texture.\", 'Sharp aromas of peach blossoms, honeyed nuts and lemon balm make for a fruity yet biting nose on this blend of 58% Grenache Blanc from Happy Canyon and 42% Viognier from San Luis Obispo County. Ripened stonefruit flavors are cut with a sizzle of acidity and warmth of sea salt and candied Meyer lemon on the palate.', \"This is a fairly light, bright Pinot Noir with the marks of a ripe year and time spent in oak. It is crafted under the guidelines of a certified sustainable grape growing program. Medium-bodied and juicy, it's fairly priced and ready to enjoy now.\", 'Not many Grand Cru wines are made into a Sec style of Champagne. This wine is more soft than sweet, with plenty of acidity as well as a touch of honey. Soft and round at the end, the wine is balanced and ready to drink.', 'This is an intense expression of steely Riesling, with a complex structure and excellent aging potential. It is full of citrus, pear and crisp pineapple flavors that are laced with concentrated acidity. Age for at least five years. Screwcap.', \"It's hard not to be a big fan of Giacomo Vico's beautiful Chardonnay. The wine marries the cool-climate characteristics of the Langhe (Piedmont) with a round, opulent and rich winemaking style. You'll recognize loads of yellow fruit and rose with a playful touch of sweet vanilla.\", \"Roasted and rubbery, this features potent leather and compost aromas that settle with airing. Angular, aggressive and full of power and lemony oak, it also has raw wood and heavily toasted black-fruit flavors. Long, peppery and choppy, it's powerful and stomping. Best to hold this for 3-5 years before drinking, when it should emerge as a better, more approachable wine.\", \"The sand and granite soil of the Brand vineyard gives an intensely structured wine that's tight and steely. It's rich with apricot and pear flavors made crisp with refreshing acidity. Drink from 2015.\", \"Whiffs of bamboo leaf, lime zest and green herb invite and invigorate on this light-bodied, off-dry Riesling. The palate is juicy and concentrated, an easy going yet tangy mix of tangerine, lemon and salty minerality that lingers long through the finish. Proceeds benefit Nashville's homeless people and pets.\", 'This is a young, fruity wine with bright acidity and red berry fruit that comes across as lean. Its structure and tannic core suggests it needs to age. Drink from 2019.', \"Castello Banfi's delicious Cum Laude is a super Tuscan blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah that opens with rich aromas of black fruit and chocolate fudge. The 30% Cabernet Sauvignon component adds background notes of exotic spice, moist tobacco and firm tannins.\", \"Austin Hope's latest releases are all about power and ripeness, and this blend of 35% Grenache, 35% Mourvadre and 30% Syrah achieves balance and elegance amidst that strength. Cuban coffee, fig jam, dried blueberry and chocolate aromas lead into a pillowy-soft palate that's layered with espresso, cocoa, roasted fig and plum jam flavors. Steady acidity and finely chiseled tannins frame it all.\", \"A stupendous Pinot Noir, showing how beautifully this vineyard performs in the remote Sonoma Coast above Fort Ross. Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it. Now-2021.\", \"Firmly tannic and rather mouth-numbing even at five years of age. Enters with a hard edge and finishes tough and gritty. Will it age? There are some black cherry flavors inside, but it's a gamble.\", 'The wine is initially soft and then begins to show a more steely, mineral character. That gives structure as well as citrus and crisp apple skin flavors. Very tight at this stage, it needs to develop, so give it until 2015.', 'With 8.1% residual sugar, this is a sweet wine. Honey flavors dominate, with underlying notes of apricots, tangerines and golden mangoes. It could be more concentrated and intense, but the sweetness is attractive. Drink now.', 'Ripe pear and yellow plum vie for prominence on the nose, while the palate is full of savory, peppery kitchen herbs like chervil, lovage and dried sage. The midpalate phenolic texture destines this for the table where it will shine with subtly spiced dishes. Wonderfully complex and long.', \"There's a seemingly sweet edge to the lemon, lime and vanilla flavors, which are fortunately balanced with crisp acidity. Fans of richly styled white wines will like this bottling.\", 'The master of Savigny-las-Beaune, Bize has produced a powerful, expressive wine from this small single vineyard. It has serious structure, although the sumptuous black-fruit flavors are already showing. Concentrated, rich and fruity, this will age for at least five years.', 'A strong hazelnut aroma meets poached pear and cotton candy on the nose of this bottling, giving a rich yet tightly woven impression. The palate is oily in texture, with walnut, dried apricot and browned apple flavors.', \"Palazzio is Testarossa's blend of various vineyards. It showcases a regional Central Coast personality, and a fine one at that. The '06 has elements of ripe cherries, raspberries and root beer, enriched with smoky oak, and appeals for its silky, crisp mouthfeel. Best now and for a year or two.\", \"Minerally lime and peach-pit aromas set up a crisp, stony, elegant palate with lees-based flavors of vanilla that are softly matched by melon and papaya. Fresh and not too demanding, it's made from 70% Garnatxa Blanca and 30% Macabeo (Viura).\", 'This is a southern and warmer take on Alvarinho than is found in northern Portugal. It brings out the ripe perfumed character of the grape. Apricot and golden plums show both the fruit and the generous texture. Drink this wine starting from late 2017.', \"La Fagiana is a bright, ruby-colored wine with aromas of forest fruit and bramble, with white almond and spice at the back. It's an easy, no-fuss expression with a clean, tart close.\", \"Right away you know this Syrah-Petit Verdot is a powerful wine. The bouquet is pointed and blasts away with cherry, berry, spice and oak aromas. It's thick, pushy and full-bodied, with minty, toasty oak flavors running side by side with blackberry. On the finish, it's more charred and toasty, with peppery spice and some heat. Drink now-2015.\", 'A fruity wine, full of grapefruit, lime and melon flavors, cut with passion fruit acidity. The wine has a light texture with a zesty edge, clean and totally ready to drink. Screwcap.', 'Cherry and plum aromas are aggressive. This energetic Malbec is beyond snappy and juicy, while salty plum and currant flavors are racy and edgy. A briny aftertaste and peppery spice flavors dominate a tough finish.', 'Aromas like white pepper and dried herbs lead to ripe, direct fruit flavors and a feeling of power from the very full body.', 'A light yet concentrated Pinot Noir, this has a cherry flavor and a spicy texture. Give it some air to allow the better side of its earthy aromas time to unravel.', 'A pretty, relatively lightweight Pinot Noir, this offering from Western Australia starts off with hints of coffee and sour cherries, then develops more herbal notes and brown sugar with air. Flavors of cola, tart cherries and root vegetables finish a bit short.', 'Full of mango and starfruit flavors to go with the nuts, spice and ripe texture. The wine, made from organic grapes, has richness as much as sweetness, the acidity an important element. For long-term aging.', 'Dancing on the nose and palate, this Pinot Noir rosa fills the glass with whiffs of cherry blossoms and sugar cookies. Tart red-cherry and berry flavors are delicate and spry on the palate, lingering nervously in a luscious mousse of soft, rolling bubbles. Finishes elegantly with a bristle of stony minerals.', 'This wine from the recently approved El Pomar District is tropically perfumed with lychee candy and a hint of passionfruit. Bouncy acidity on the front of the palate leads into red apple fruit and citrus skin bitterness, and wipes up with a zing on the palate.', \"Bright red fruit highlights this soft wine. Acidity and hint of stalky tannins give its red berry flavors a boost. It's easygoing and ready to drink.\", 'This blend of 58% Petite Sirah and 42% Zinfandel provides a good example of a winery going over the top and succeeding. Aromas recall blackberry-laced tea, dried rose petals and Luxardo cherries. Cassis provides the centerpoint of the flavor profile, with a backbone of ample tannins and touch of tar.', 'A little one-dimensional, but offers enough cherry, red currant and smoky oak flavors to get by for everyday eating. A good example of the art of blending, with 115,000 cases produced.', 'This blend of Touriga Nacional and Castelao has produced an impressive wine that is packed with rich tannins and a dark brooding structure. Intense acidity cuts through the rich, powerful texture to give a fresh aftertaste. It is still young, so drink from 2018.', \"Citrus blossom and leesy vanilla notes open this balanced aromatic white from Argentina's north. Leesy tropcial-fruit flavors focus on lychee and lime. The wine is moderately long on a simple but solid finish.\", 'In hommage to the man who pioneered the use of oak to ferment Sauvignon Blanc, this wood-fermented and matured wine is only produced in the best years. It is rich and just toasty, but equally about the structured mineral texture and ripe citrus. It is a wine to age, so drink from 2018.', 'This inviting Pinot is broadly ripe and fully lush in earthy, spicy layers, dark cherry and plum that plays across the palate. With a long, substantial finish, iot suits pork roasts and bacon-wrapped scallops.', \"A terrific value if you can find it (alas, only 150 cases were imported), this is full bodied and richly textured, marrying hints of peppery spice with grilled lavender and rosemary that perfectly season the beach cherry and mocha flavors. It's stout, tannic and mouth coating on the finish, ideal for matching with roasts or steaks. Drink 2018-2025.\", \"Earthy tones of smoke and hazelnuts give way to bright white peach and grapefruit notes on the nose and palate of this fruitful Pinot Gris. Off dry in style, it's a tad sugary on the midpalate, but finishes fairly dry with a refreshing shower of lemony acidity. Drink now.\", \"One of the strengths of cool Beira Interior is that it produces powerful wines without the attendant alcohol of warmer climates. That's apparent with this intense, dark wine. Blending Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz, the dense and brooding wine with its rich blackberry fruitiness alongside dry, mineral tannins is a study in concentration and needs to age. Drink from 2018.\", \"It's mouthfeel smacks hard with acidity, leaving a crisp expression of strawberry, raspberry and herb flavors. It turns warm, lactic and chocolaty on the finish.\", 'This leesy, bready, heavily toasted Brazilian sparkler offers heady vanilla and caramel notes on the nose. A round, plump, soda-like palate is home to toasty, leesy, lightly oxidized apple flavors that finish briny, bready and marginally fresh. Drink now.', \"Very tart, with a deep, tannic, earthy mineral streak. There's an iron/earth streak running through all Abacela wines; here it comes across as iron and slightly bitter licorice. This is still very young and green; the score might well improve with more time in the bottle.\", \"Creamy and rooty at first, and then smokier and darker as it settles. For young Malbec it displays both a jammy fruit side and an acidic center. So there's both ripeness and heft but also a piercing sizzle. Perfectly good for parties and less-serious imbibing.\", 'While there is a somewhat meaty edge to this wine, it also has good rich texture. It probably needs time to bring out the full potential of its ripe yellow fruits.', 'A pure, fresh line runs through this delicate rosa. It shows more white fruits than red, just hinting at red currants, but more of fresh white berries. There is just some hint of sweetness, more from the fruit of 2003 than from any extra dosage.', 'First bottle corked. Second bottle sound, but rather one dimensional. The fruit is simple green apple and green berry; but there is a distinct earthy undertone that carries into the finish. If new oak barrels were used, they are not evident.', 'Lemon zest, lime and melon aromas lead this elegant white blend. Zesty citrus and lush melon on the palate offers a refined character that is nonetheless fine for everyday enjoyment. The finish is expressive and slightly floral.', \"The wine has the correct texture and attractive perfumes for a delicate Riesling. The crisp apple and tight mineral flavors are light and floating. It's a surprising wine for the Lisbon region, but it works so well.\", 'Deep aromas of hibiscus, rose buds, dark red berries and sugar plums are spiced up by cola, crushed pencils and lots of garrigue on this bottling. The palate is clean and crisp, with snappy raspberry, light cranberry and lots more chaparral-like herbs, including wild thyme, bay laurel, lavender and fennel pollen.', \"Off-dry with a candied orange character, this is indeed a malange, including portions of seven different white wine grapes. It's an interesting wine, though might prove a bit challenging to match to food. Perhaps a curry?\", 'A spicy, creamy wine that manages to give freshness and intense varietal character at the same time. The overall effect is of lightness and elegance as well as spiciness and richness.', 'This is a plump, medium-bodied rosa at a reasonable price. Pomelo or grapefruit notes combine with stone fruit, then finish stony-dry and tart.', 'Bold and ripe in cherry jam flavors. Oak brings buttered toast to the mix. Delicious and savory, this Pinot is solidly in the ripe California style of forward fruit and immediate flash. Drink now and through 2014.', 'Bland, sweet aromas are not persuasive. This feels cloying and sticky due to a lot of sugar and not much acidity. Soapy, sweet flavors finish with bitter notes.', \"La Casita is made entirely from Dijon clone 114. It's a total -wow- wine, from the very first sip. Rich black cherry, chocolate and caramel flavors wrap tightly together. That firm and full-bodied richness continues through the midpalate. Enjoy this outstanding bottle over the next three or four years.\", \"A mind-bending array of aromas come to play in this bottling by Winemaker Billy Wathen, with savory tones of crushed pepper, teriyaki, fresh but underripe berry fruit, piquant forest underbrush, wet chaparral and raw lamb gaminess. It's surprisingly light and lithe on the lovely palate, with black peppercorn, thyme, lavender and complex beef-stew notes.\", 'Most barrel-fermented Marlborough Sauvignons will set you back close to twice as much, making this a bargain. Awesomely pungent and smoky aromas leap from the glass, followed by complex flavors that range from saline to pink grapefruit and stone fruit. Drink this full-bodied, silky-textured wine over the next year or two.', 'Very, sweet, with molasses, oatmeal cookie, blackberry jam, chocolate, vanilla and spice flavors. Could be more concentrated for the sweetness. The blend is mainly Petite Sirah, with the balance comprised of traditional Port varieties.', 'The punchy nose brings spice notes that are sharp on the inhale. This is tight on the palate, with tartaric acid rising up through a medium-weight body. Black plum, cherry, oak and spice flavors finish dry but hollow.', 'Ripe, black-skinned fruit, dark spice and chopped herbs abound on this structured red. The big, bold palate offers ripe black cherry, blackberry extract, mocha and licorice while round tannins envelop the palate.', 'Pepper and power mark this impressively rich wine. Tropical fruits, mangos and lychees are layered with minerality and acidity. A wine that needs some aging in order to release the full potential of its structure and fruit weight.', \"Pinot Noir specialist Bryan Babcock explores this aromatic white grape, delivering a lush and creamy expression. Poached pear and orange blossom notes combine with a nutty quality on the nose, while the wine's creamy consistency meets buoyant acidity on the palate. Lush apple, pear and cashews flavors complete the picture.\", '91-93 A very complete wine, packed with just the right level of tannins and with the sweet plum fruit pushing through to give richness to the acidity.', 'There is a barnyard feel to this wine, from its rustic aromas through the edgy berry fruit to the final flavors of acidity and beetroot. The character gives licorice and spice as well as blackberry fruits.', 'After recently tasting a knockout bottle of the 2005, this was disappointing. Ample cinnamon and mocha notes accent slightly pruny flavors; the tannins are soft, while the acids provide a lemony edge to the finish.', \"This isn't the biggest or ripest Cates du Rhane, but it balances hints of greenness with fresh cherry fruit. The floral notes on the nose are attractive, while the wine finishes firm and crisp.\", 'Roasted fruit, road tar and barrel notes play a big role on the nose, which is otherwise regular and not particularly individual. The palate offers red-fruit jam, butter and pepper flavors, while the finish has some bite and definitive snap. Plenty good enough to drink but lacking completeness and texture.', 'Violet, dark-skinned berry and balsamic notes come together in this ripe, round wine. The palate delivers black cherry, tobacco and thyme flavors, bolstered by assertive tannins. Enjoy 2018-2023.', 'Sourced from two vineyards, including Sangiacomo Amaral Ranch, a cool site near the bay, this is a tremendous offering for the price. The wine is light, bright and brambly in raspberry and cherry kirsch, with a mischievous streak of cola. Pretty and fresh, it finishes in a tease of black tea.', 'This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (60%) and Merlot. Cocoa, baking chocolate and dark-fruit aromas lead to ripe generous black-fruit flavors, backed by well-integrated tannins. The finish lingers.', \"Alluring aromas of menthol, red berry, rose and herb lift out of the glass. The rounded solid palate offers raspberry, morello cherry, a touch of clove and a hint of cinnamon framed in firm tannins. It's straightforward by Barolo standards but it's appealing and already almost accessible. Drink after 2021.\", \"Still very firm, this wine shows the tannic structure of the vintage. Because it's beginning to mature, it also shows it's not likely to open up much more. Big and hard to like.\", 'This is a herbal, earthy wine with as many tannins as fruit at this stage. That gives it a dense, dusty texture that seeps into the ripe, sweet plum flavors. With the wood giving an extra push of richness as well as spice, it needs to age. Drink from 2017.', \"With an orange-pink color, this is really a rosa wine. It's sweet and sugary, with raspberry and watermelon flavors that are balanced by cleansing acids.\", \"Coming from the warm 2012 vintage, the notes vary from stone fruit, such as apricot, into tropical with dried pineapple. Aged in a mixture of stainless steel and older French oak barrels, it's fresh and appealing while also displaying some weight and density, drinking quite dry with a tart finish.\", 'Scented impressions of ripe pear and aloe vera pervade this wine. The palate shows texture and more fruit than you might expect from slender Sylvaner. The finish is brisk, clean and taut.', 'No doubt, this is a simple and sharp wine from northern Italy but it would make a perfect pairing partner to easy grilled lamb or pork chops. It offers clean aromas of wild berry and almond and the mouthfeel is thin and compact.', \"The top wine from this estate is a blend of Syrah and Braucol. It is still firm and tannic, rich with perfumed black fruits. Made from the property's oldest vines and wood aged, it has hints of licorice as well as a toasty edge. The wine needs to be aged, so drink from 2020.\", 'Sourced from grapes grown in the Cate Chalonnaise, this is a soft, red-fruit-flavored wine, with a ripe, jammy character that makes it almost sweet. It is ready to drink.', \"Lavender and ripe black-cherry aromas are enticing on this Pinot Noir. Dry and full bodied, it doesn't have a lot of concentration, but it's softly fruity, with hints of soil and autumn leaf.\", 'This garnet-colored Pinot Noir is named after Alexander the Great III The Macedon. It has aromas of cherry and vanilla and bright top notes of fresh red raspberry. Medium bodied, it delivers fresh flavors of cranberry and cherry in the finish.', 'This 100% Vranec presents the nose with black plum, blackberry, tobacco leaf and saddle leather and the palate with blueberry, dried herbs, tobacco and red plums. The finish is soft and elegant.', \"This Chardonnay has an appealing nose that's both fruity and toasty, with complex, lush flavors of Chardonnay fruit, vanilla and toasted wood. A spirited but elegant wine that will pair well with poultry, cheeses or richer fish.\", 'This Macedonian wine made from 100% uilavka has aromas of honeysuckle and peach. Balanced in the mouth, it has flavors of green papaya and tart pineapple.']\n",
